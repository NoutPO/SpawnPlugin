This is a very simple Spawn Plugin, with only two commands: 
  /spawn
  /setspawn   (premission = spawn.set)
  
This makes it very lightweight. 
This is my first every serious plugin so please don't hate if you do not like it. 
Altho if you want to help me improve it and make me a better code please suggest stuf on my discord: NoutLost_#7665
